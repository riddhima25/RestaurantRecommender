# RestaurantRecommender
Final Project for EECS 6893: Big Data Analytics. 

12-7-20: Deepak's submission:
  -I added some Python code to find restaurants, and neighboring restaurants within a certain radius, and mapping restaurants essentially using Matplotlib.
  -Next thing is to use the restaurant data to create a map on the front end, using whatever framework (Django, Flask, with necessary libraries).
